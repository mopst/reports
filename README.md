# MOPST Reports

The BCHT GIS modelling report (MOPST) is the full report on the Mapping Opportunities and Pressures for Sustainable Tourism (MOPST) QGIS model.

This includes methods, results and discussion of findings and implications along with notes on transferability, implementation and next steps.

This was created as part of the BioCultural Heritage Tourism Project by the University of Exeter, Geospatial Training Solutions and Devon County Council.

It was funded by the EU Interreg France (Channel) England Programme and implemented in four UNESCO Biosphere Reserves - 2 in England, 2 in France:

North Devon Biosphere Reserve, Brighton and Lewes Downs Biosphere Reserve, Réserve de Biosphère Iles et Mer d’Iroise and Réserve de Biosphère Marais Audomarois.
